# Python-Everything is object

## Who am I? 🧐

To know the object's type is the game,
What function to call, can you name?
Answer in the file, don't be shy,
"type" without the () is your reply.

## Where are you? 🧭

To find an object's memory place,
You'll need a function to embrace.
Its name is what we want to know,
Write it down, and you're good to go.

## Right count ➡️

When "a" and "b" we do create,
Are they pointing to the same state?
"Yes" or "No" is all we ask,
Tell us if they share a common task.

## Right count = ⬆️

With numbers equal, "a" and "b" both,
Are they a single or separate growth?
Tell us if they share the same home,
A simple "Yes" or a clear "No."

## Right count =+ ✚

When "a" is added, a new fate,
With "+1" its value does inflate.
Do "a" and "b" the same thread spin?
Answer with "Yes" or "No," begin!

## Is equal 🤝

In the world of strings, "s1" and "s2" dwell,
Do they share a content spell?
"True" or "False" is what we seek,
Their equality, your answer speaks.

## Is the same 👯

When "s1" and "s2" we declare,
Do they the same identity bear?
"True" or "False," just make it clear,
Share your answer, remove the fear.

## Is really equal 🌟

In "Best School" they both reside,
Equality in their strings, can't hide.
"True" or "False," tell us the game,
With confidence, state if they're the same.

## Is really the same 🌟

"Best School" as their common name,
Identity's claim, is it their aim?
"True" or "False," is what we seek,
Are they truly the same, or just a peek?

## And with a list, is it equal ✅

In lists "l1" and "l2," numbers unite,
Equality's test, their fate is bright.
"True" or "False," the truth unfold,
Share your answer, let the story be told.

## And with a list, is it the same 🔄

"l1" and "l2" are lists, it's true,
The identity test, what will it construe?
"True" or "False," what's your bet?
Do they share the same attribute set?

## And with a list, is it really equal 🔄

"l1" and "l2," on the same path they trod,
Equality of content, their silent nod.
"True" or "False," make your call,
Is equality their banner, standing tall?

## And with a list, is it really the same 🧩

"l1" and "l2," in a close embrace,
Identity's claim, a secret space.
"True" or "False," your answer give,
Are they truly the same, or just a sieve.

## List append ➕

With "l1" and "l2," a connection found,
When "l1" grows, will "l2" astound?
Print their union, let us see,
The magic of lists, what will it be?

## List add ➕

"l1" and "l2," a different show,
When "l1" is added, where will it go?
Print "l2," is it a reflection true,
Or a separate world, a different view?

## Integer incrementation 🔢

"a" starts as 1, a journey to take,
"increment" function, what's at stake?
The print reveals, what will it be?
The magic of integers, let us see!

## List incrementation 🔢

A list "l" with values three,
"increment" function sets them free.
What will be printed, what will unfurl?
The tale of lists, give it a whirl!

## List assignation 🧬

"l1" and "l2," in two different spheres,
"assign_value" function, what appears?
Print "l1," and let us know,
Will it stay the same or will it grow?

## Copy a list object 📜

Copy a list, that's your task,
Make it in 3 lines, no need to ask.
"copy_list" function, make it shine,
An exact replica, your design.

## Tuple or not? 🤔

With parentheses, "a" does start,
Is it a tuple, or is it apart?
Answer "Yes" or "No," make it clear,
The truth of tuples, what's up here?

## Tuple or not? 🤔

A tuple or not, that's the quest,
With commas inside, is "a" the best?
Answer with "Yes" or a clear "No,"
Tuples or not, let your answer glow.

## 24. Who I am? 🕵️

In a world of objects, where 'a' and 'b' align,
Do they share an identity, or is it just a sign?
The answer to this mystery, for 'a is b' you must scan,
The answer is 'False,' in the Python land.

## 25. Tuple or not 🧮

In the land of tuples, where numbers do entwine,
Do 'a' and 'b' share a tuple sign?
The answer is 'True,' these tuples are aligned,
In Python's embrace, their identity defined.

## 26. Empty is not empty 🧹

In the realm of emptiness, where parentheses reside,
Do 'a' and 'b' share an identity? You must decide.
The answer is 'True,' in the world of empty space,
Where 'a' and 'b' find their resting place.

## 27. Still the same? 🔄

With 'id(a)' we begin, a unique number we receive,
Then 'a' transforms, will 'id(a)' still believe?
The answer is 'No,' as 'id(a)' takes its flight,
In Python's world, it changes overnight.

## 28. Same or not? ✅

In Python's world, where lists may grow,
'a' undergoes changes, as 'id' we bestow.
The answer is 'Yes,' as 'id(a)' remains steady,
Through the trials and changes, it's always ready.

## 29. #pythonic ✨

In Python's heart, a function so bright,
'Magic_string' it's called, to give us some light.
With 'BestSchool' it dances, n times in its hand,
A Pythonic rhythm, across the land.

## 30. Low memory cost 🧩

LockedClass it's named, with rules so firm,
No attributes may bloom, except for 'first_name' affirm.
In Python's domain, it guards like a sentry,
No last names allowed, a class of low-entry.

## 31. int 1/3 🔢

With integers 'a' and 'b,' a story we weave,
How many objects from them, Python does conceive?
Two integers, two objects, in the Python's tale,
In the realm of numbers, their presence does prevail.

## 32. int 2/3 🔢

With integers 'a' and 'b,' we enter the zone,
Deleted and created, how many will be known?
One's creation and deletion, 'a' leaves its trace,
While 'b' disappears, in Python's embrace.

## 33. int 3/3 🔢

In the world of integers, Python's domain,
Before 'Love' is printed, how many remain?
None are created, in Python's array,
For small integers are cached, to save the day.

## 34. Clear strings 📜

In the world of strings, a mystery to pursue,
How many are created, before they bid adieu?
One string's birth, but it lingers through and through,
In Python's memory, the strings continue to debut.

Feel the artistry in Python as you explore and master these elegant data structures and algorithms. Enjoy your journey through the world of Python! 🚀🐍 Happy coding! 🎉
