# Python - More Classes and Objects

## 0. Simple Rectangle 🖼️

A Rectangle class, canvas for your art,
Without any modules, a Python work of heart.

## 1. Real Definition of a Rectangle 📐

Width and height, they must be integers so right,
In the Rectangle class, errors are caught in plain sight.

## 2. Area and Perimeter 📏

Calculate area and perimeter, with width and height in tow,
In the Rectangle class, these functions steal the show.

## 3. String Representation 🖋️

A canvas of # symbols, with width and height intact,
The Rectangle class prints beauty, in code, that's a fact.

## 4. Eval is Magic 🎩

With eval() and repr(), the Rectangle's recreated,
Magic in strings, its art is celebrated.

## 5. Detect Instance Deletion 🧹

"Bye rectangle..." it whispers, when it's time to part,
Deletion's message, with grace, it will depart.

## 6. How Many Instances 🔢

Counting rectangles, as they're born and they disappear,
Instance tracking, with each new frontier.

## 7. Change Representation 🎨

Customizing the symbols, from # to & with glee,
A Rectangle's print_symbol, personalized with esprit.

## 8. Compare Rectangles 🧲

Comparing rectangles, area decides their fate,
A static method's wisdom, to find out who is great.

## 9. A Square is a Rectangle 🔳

In the world of rectangles, squares are fair and square,
A class method's power, their symmetry to declare.

## 10. N Queens ♛

For N queens on the chessboard, the challenge is to aspire,
With N greater than or equal to four, solutions we'll acquire.

Feel the artistry in Python as you explore and master these elegant data structures and algorithms. Enjoy your journey through the world of Python! 🚀🐍 Happy coding! 🎉
