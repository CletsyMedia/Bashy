# Python 🐍 Inheritance

In Python, inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create a new class (a subclass or child class) by deriving properties and behaviors from an existing class (a superclass or parent class). Inheritance promotes code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical structure of classes.

Inheritance is used to create a new class that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class. In Python, a subclass can inherit properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) from a superclass. The subclass can then add additional attributes or methods or override the ones inherited.

## Task 0: Lookup

🔍 **Lookup**

Lookup for secrets, attributes, and more,
Return a list of what the object has in store.

## Task 1: My List

⚙️ **My List**

MyList inherits, ascending it sorts,
Of integers, in Python's world of sorts.

## Task 2: Exact Same Class

❓ **Exact Same Class**

Inheritance and classes, where Python thrives,
Check if they match, with truth as our guide.

## Task 3: Same Class or Inherit From

🔄 **Same Class or Inherit From**

Is it the same class, or inherit they must?
With Python's magic, we answer and trust.

## Task 4: Only Subclass Of

🌳 **Only Subclass Of**

Directly or indirectly, inheritance chain,
Answer the question, Python's knowledge gain.

## Task 5: Geometry Module

🔷 **Geometry Module**

Geometry's canvas, a base to create,
An empty class, in Python's state.

## Task 6: Improve Geometry

📐 **Improve Geometry**

Expand the horizons, define the space,
Raise an Exception, in this code's embrace.

## Task 7: Integer Validator

🔢 **Integer Validator**

Validate the integers, by Python's decree,
Raise exceptions for names and values to see.

## Task 8: Rectangle

🟦 **Rectangle**

Geometry unfolds, rectangles arise,
With width and height, their shape complies.

## Task 9: Full Rectangle

🔲 **Full Rectangle**

In [Rectangle] format, a rectangle's description,
With width and height, in Python's inception.

## Task 10: Square #1

◼️ **Square #1**

From Rectangle's legacy, a Square takes flight,
With size as its essence, it stands upright.

## Task 11: Square #2

◻️ **Square #2**

Square or Rectangle, the identity unique,
In [Square] format, its answer it speaks.

## Task 12: My Integer

🔄 **My Integer**

MyInt emerges, Python's rules defy,
Equality operators, switched on the fly.

## Task 13: Can I?

🔺 **Can I?**

Adding attributes, with Python's rule,
Raise TypeError, let Python be the tool.

Feel the artistry in Python as you explore and master these elegant data structures and algorithms. Enjoy your journey through the world of Python! 🚀🐍 Happy coding! 🎉
