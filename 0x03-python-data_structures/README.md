# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

Welcome to the Python Data Structures repository! Here you will find a collection of Python functions and scripts that demonstrate the power and versatility of lists and tuples. These structures are the backbone of many Python programs, and I've crafted these scripts from the ALX-SE to help you explore their capabilities in an elegant way.

## 0. Easy print 🎨

Paint the canvas with '#pythoniscool', a simple masterpiece in just two elegant strokes.

## 1. Secure access to an element in a list 🚀

Retrieve an element from a list like a seasoned artist. Handle negative indices gracefully and stay within bounds.

## 2. Replace element ✨

Transform a list like a master sculptor, replacing an element at a specific position.

## 3. Print a list of integers... in reverse! 🔄

Craft a poetic function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

## 4. Replace in a copy 🎭

Elegantly replace an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original masterpiece.

## 5. Can you C me now? 🔍

Master the art of removing all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string with surgical precision.

## 6. Lists of lists = Matrix 🧮

Paint a beautiful matrix of integers with this function.

## 7. Tuples addition 🎶

Compose a function that adds 2 tuples with the grace of a symphony conductor.

## 8. More returns! 📜

Craft a function that returns the length of a string and its first character with finesse.

## 9. Find the max 🕵️

Unearth the biggest integer hidden within a list.

## 10. Only by 2 ✌️

Identify the multiples of 2 in a list and create a new list with True or False to indicate their presence.

## 11. Delete at ❌

Remove an item at a specific position in a list, preserving the rest of the artwork.

## 12. Switch 🔀

Switch the values of two variables in just five lines of code.

## 13. Linked list palindrome 🕰️

Check if a singly linked list is a palindrome with the precision of a watchmaker.

## 14. CPython #0: Python lists (Advanced) 🧙‍♂️

Peek behind the curtain and explore the magic of Python lists with CPython. A shared library reveals the secrets of Python list internals.

Feel the artistry in Python as you explore and master these elegant data structures and algorithms. Enjoy your journey through the world of Python! 🚀🐍 Happy coding! 🎉
