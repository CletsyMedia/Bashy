# 🐍 - Test Driven Development

1. ## Integers Addition** 🧮

   In 🐍's land, where numbers reside,
   Two integers unite, in an addition's stride.
   The function is crafted, with checks so tight,
   Exception raises when the inputs aren't right. 💥

2. ## Divide a Matrix** 📊

   In the matrix's realm, where numbers align,
   A division takes place, with precision in mind.
   Rows must be of equal size, and that's the clue,
   If not, exceptions rise, with messages so true. 💔

3. ## Say My Name** 🗣️

   Names are spoken, in 🐍's sweet tone,
   First and last, in a function well known.
   Strings they must be, no other shall pass,
   For 🐍 to say, your name with class. 🎙️

4. ## Print Square** 🟦

   🐍 prints squares, of any size you choose,
   But negative ones, it firmly refuses.
   An integer it wants, no floats allowed,
   Exception shouts if the rules aren't endowed. 🚫

5. ## Text Indentation** 📝

   Text with dots, question marks, and more,
   🐍 adds new lines, as per the lore.
   Strings they must be, no errors allowed,
   🐍's grace with text, it's all avowed. 🧴

6. ## Max Integer - Unittest** 🧪

   Unittests come forth, in this coding spree,
   For max integer, we test with glee.
   🐍's power, in tests, we unleash,
   To ensure our function, will never breach. ✅

7. ## Matrix Multiplication** 🧩

   Matrices are multiplied, with precision so clear,
   🐍's function handles, without any fear.
   Lists of integers, in arrays so neat,
   The result is a matrix, a masterpiece to meet. 🌟

8. ## Lazy Matrix Multiplication** 🍃

   Matrices are multiplied, with NumPy's grace,
   A library's power, in this 🐍's space.
   No errors allowed, all tests we endure,
   With NumPy's might, the code's allure. 🔄

9. ## C🐍 #3: 🐍 Strings** 🧵

   C🐍, 🐍's core, a secret to unbind,
   Handling strings gracefully, with errors in mind.
   In 🐍's embrace, we print strings so fine,
   With C🐍's power, in each and every line. 🌐

Let 🐍's beauty and elegance continue to shine in your code! ✨🐍
